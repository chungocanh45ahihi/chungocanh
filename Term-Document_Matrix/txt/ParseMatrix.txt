Sparse Matrix and its representations

A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values. If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a sparse matrix.

Why to use Sparse Matrix instead of simple matrix ?

    Storage: There are lesser non-zero elements than zeros and thus lesser memory can be used to store only those elements.
    Computing time: Computing time can be saved by logically designing a data structure traversing only non-zero elements..

Representing a sparse matrix by a 2D array leads to wastage of lots of memory as zeroes in the matrix are of no use in most of the cases. So, instead of storing zeroes with non-zero elements, we only store non-zero elements. This means storing non-zero elements with triples- (Row, Column, value). 

Sparse Matrix Representations can be done in many ways following are two common representations: 

    1. Array representation
    2. Linked list representation

Method 1: Using Arrays:

2D array is used to represent a sparse matrix in which there are three rows named as 
    Row: Index of row, where non-zero element is located
    Column: Index of column, where non-zero element is located
    Value: Value of the non zero element located at index â€“ (row,column)

Time Complexity:  O(NM), where N is the number of rows in the sparse matrix, and M is the number of columns in the sparse matrix.

Auxiliary Space: O(NM), where N is the number of rows in the sparse matrix, and M is the number of columns in the sparse matrix.
